-- For an object to conform to the Connectable Protocol it must have the following:
--
-- Functions:
--      getIncomingConnectionPoints() - Returns a 2 dimensional table of incoming connection
--                                      points. The returned table uses the type of connection point
--                                      as a key. The value associated (if any) with that key is a
--                                      numerically indexed table whose keys start at 1. Each entry
--                                      in the numerically indexed table is a point in world space
--                                      that indicates the location of a connection point.
--      getOutgoingConnectionPoints() - Returns a 2 dimensional table of outgoing connection points.
--                                      The returned table uses the type of connection point as a
--                                      key. The value associated (if any) with that key is a

--                                      in the numerically indexed table is a point in world space
